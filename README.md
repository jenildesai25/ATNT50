# ATNT50
CSE 5334(Data Mining) project to classify images using classification, linear regression, centroid not using any external libraries.

KNN takes data(data frame) in row format. that means every row contains one image and starting 1st value is the label.
For Example: data frame should be in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] here 1 is the label and after that [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is the data.

Centroid takes data(data frame) in row format.
For Example: data frame should be in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] here 1 is the label and after that [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is the data.

SVM takes data(data frame) in row format.
For Example: data frame should be in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] here 1 is the label and after that [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is the data.

Linear Regression takes data(data frame) in column format.
